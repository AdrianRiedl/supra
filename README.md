A 2D and 3D Pipeline from Beamforming to B-mode
----------------

**SUPRA** is an open-source pipeline for fully software 
defined ultrasound processing for real-time applications.
Covering everything from beamforming to output of B-Mode images, SUPRA
can help reproducibility of results and allows modifications to the image acquisition.

Including all processing stages of a usual ultrasound pipeline, it can be executed in 2D and 3D on consumer GPUs in real-
time. Even on hardware as small as the CUDA enabled Jetson TX2 **SUPRA** can be run for 2D imaging in real-time.
